Diamante (English Version) Lyrics[Verse 1: Zucchero]
Where do I go when part of me is dying?
Somewhere they're baking new bread
There's peace in my life

I'll be the rain, and you'll be heaven crying
And my eyes will be filled with flowers
Upon the snowfields of white

[Refrain: Zucchero, Randy Crawford]
And we will learn to walk together
Oh hand in hand, we'll walk together
Domenica
[Verse 2: Zucchero, Randy Crawford, Both]
Waiting for you (Waiting for you), I'll drink a glass of wine
My heart will explode again
And we'll be larger than life, yeah

Time in the distance, will bring me to your side
From high up in heaven, Diamante
We'll see peace with our eyes

[Refrain: Zucchero, Randy Crawford, Both]
We'll see them walking, the brides and soldiers
Dancing, the dark, they melt together
Against the twilight
And all together (And all together) we'll lift our voices
Singing the time, to play at soldiers
Is gone forever
Is gone forever, Domenica
Domenica

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Zucchero, Randy Crawford, Both]
We'll see them walking, the brides and soldiers
Dancing, the dark, they melt together
Against the twilight
And all together, we'll lift our voices
Singing the time, to play at soldiers
Is gone forever
Oh, DomenicaYou might also likeEmbed
