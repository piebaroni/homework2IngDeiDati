Senza una donna (English version) LyricsI changed the world
I changed the world
I changed the world
I wanna change the world
This ain't the way, I spend my mornings baby
Come stai?
You been with him, and you come back my lady
What's he like?
I just sit and watch the ocean
By myself, even doing my own cookin'
You can laugh and you're forgiven, but
I'm no longer frightened, to be livin'
Senza una donna
No more pain and no sorrow
Senza una donna
I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna
Givin' me torture and bliss
Without a woman
Better like this
There is no way, that you can buy me baby
Don't make fun
You got to dig, a little deeper lady
In the heart? Yeah, if you have one
Here's my heart, feel the power
Look at me, look at me, I'm a flower
You can laugh, and you're forgiven, but
I'm no longer frightened, to be livin'
Senza una donna
No more pain and no sorrow
Senza una donna
I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna
Givin' me torture and bliss
I stay here, an' watch the ocean
Don't know why, don't know why, I keep on talkin', I keep on talkin'
You may laugh, you're forgiven, but
I'm no longer frightened maybe to be livin'
Senza una donna
No more pain and no sorrow
Senza una donna
You know I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna
Givin' me torture and bliss
Without a woman
Vieni qui, come on in
Senza una donna
I don't know what might follow
Senza una donna
Maybe from tomorrow
Senza una donna
Givin' me torture and blissYou might also likeEmbed
